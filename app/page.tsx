              My name is Anton Koller and I am a 27 year old programmer with
              experience in JavaScript and TypeScript whilst simultaneously
              learning to code in both C# and Python to expand my capabilities.
              I am also versed in the use of various related frameworks and
              modules that accompany JS and TS, such as React, Next.js (which
              this website is built using), Express, Vue and Node to name a
              couple. Besides JavaScript, I am also experienced with MySQL and
              Git/GitHub, alongside the obvious CSS and HTML skills. I am
              currently working on expanding my knowledge of other JS frameworks
              like Angular to learn more about the various applications these
              frameworks have. You can find a link to my GitHub below!
